      <p class="about_me">Not a programmer or a developer, just like you may cook
         sometimes but that doesn't mean you are a chef. I don't code for any
         purpose like some people learn to code to get into their dream companies
         but I don't have any such aim for working in companies, LoL. I just do coding for fun.
         I have made lots of apps, games, and a few websites too. Also, I use Python
         mostly to make things easy in my day-to-day life and also to do many interesting things.</p>
         <p class="about_me">I also do game development using C sharp and unity engine. Game development
         is quite a fun thing to do and also who doesn't like to play and make games.</p>
         <p class="about_me">This site is created by me using HTML and CSS.</p>
         <p class="about_me">I started learning programming online at <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>
         near about 6 months ago.</p>
